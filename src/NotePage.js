        I know I really am not so clear, and it might even seem like I am a different person when we are talking than texting. I mean, sometimes these days I even am a little moody because I wanna talk to you but i am also not asking you, and i really am not trying to over do or overstep tbh.
        Also, this is me trying to be a little more clear, especially about tthe things in my head so it might be a bit much to vocalize but oh well. Also, just cus I have not known you for that long doesn't mean you are insignificant or anything tbh, but being told so many things can be a surprise and even overwhelming but I think clarity is just better. I mean, for a bit, I did not want to misinterpret or overstep some things, you know? Just enjoy the moments and it is what it is.

        I mean "time" is really not that much to ask for; it is the bare minimum.

        I honestly hate that it may appear that I don't want to spend time when I truly do want to spend time with you. It genuinely disturbs me for you to think otherwise. You should know that I love for you to bring me into your world so that I can learn about you, and when we do things together, we learn about how each other and how eachother think, ya know? Your energy and your brain are quite unique I would sayðŸ¤·.

        I also know you feel that you are "forcing" us to spend time and that the effort seems one-sided. And I know that it is a combination of my poor communication and lack of clarity that may make you feel that I am disinterested. I mean, I know it feels forced if you are always the one asking to spend time. Seriously though, I know it is frustrating to deal with people like that and it is annoying when it feels like you are the only one contributing. From your perspective, I would ask you to spend time if I really wanted to spend time, right? But that is not the case. I just struggle asking 'cus I think and think a lot, so I make myself available to you and I sit around and wait for you to come and spend time when you are free or want to, and it bothers me because I know that is makes everything feel one-sided and I know I should not put all the weight on you. I already know that you get a lil pissed when people aren't clear and so on. I mean, it might even be weird to say "spend time" because it is not like we have known eachother long at all, yet it is still something I have found joy in. Not even trying to be overpressing or anything, just the truth.

        We spent so much time in a little amount of time, you know? I couldn't really get enough of you to be honest (you said something along those lines as well about not really wanting to hang up); and that is the truth still. I mean, you are on my mind a whole lot, and what bothers me more is that I will just sit here and think about messaging you all day instead of just messaging you or think about spending time instead of just asking or something.

        And I do find myself missing you tbh (sounds extreme i know but i mean my brain does what it wants idk), even though I don't respond to you and tell you that in return when you told me you miss me or whatever. I mean, some parts could be explained, but not really trying to go overboard with how much I am typing here. So this is in part to say my bad for making you feel that i am ghosting you, for being inconsistent (something i need to work on), and not being very clear (need to work on but also a lot more to it). I promise I do appreciate the time you have given me and for teaching me things about you directly and indirectly (sometimes i experiment on you lowkey *in a non dangerous way* just to see how you think too tbh). Also, my bad for typing all this and i swear i had this organized the other day and it was a lot more clear but now it is just a flow of spontane thoughts smh lol
